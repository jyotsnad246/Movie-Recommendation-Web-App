# Movie Recommendation System

### OVERVIEW

This project aims to demonstrate various movie recommendation algorithms used by major platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime.

Métflix is a recommendation engine of movies from the given dataset.

For educational purposes, the project shall begin with the most basic algorithms or techniques used in a recommendation, and progressively build upon them to implement more advanced and sophisticated techniques. Finally, the project will enable a user to get movie recommendations through content based filtering.

### WORKING

The user interface is meant to be as self-descriptive as possible.

### PROJECT FLOW

### DATASETS

The datasets have been taken form Kaggle. There are two sets of data in the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, movies data and credits data.

-   <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv>
-   <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_credits.csv>

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Before preprocessing we clean data and take out only the required and necessary data that can be worked upon on.

-   Firstly libraries such as NumPy, ast and Pandas are imported along with the above mentioned data.
-   Then both the datasets are merged on the basis of the title of the movie.
-   Then unnecessary columns which cannot be used as tags are dropped.

### PREPROCESSING

-   Dataset is checked for null values and then the rows with null values are dropped.
-   Dataset is checked for duplicate values and then the duplicate entry is removed.
-   The dataset is simplified on into fewer columns(3).
-   Various further steps are performed to simplify the data.

### TEXT VECTORIZATION

-   Converting tags to vectors using bag of words technique.
-   Class PorterStemmer is imported and a helper function is created to convert string to list and then stemming each word.
-   CountVectorizer class imported as cv to covert a collection of text documents to a matrix of  token counts.
-   Then tags are explicitly converted into NumPy array as cv returns sci-py sparks matric.

### MODEL - COSINE SIMILARITY

-   Here we are dealing with high dimensions of data, so Euclidian distance fails, hence we use cosine similarity model here.
-   Similarity matrix is an array of arrays whose diagonal will always be one.
-   A list of tuples is generated and then a sorted list in reverse order on the basis of cosine distance.
-   A recommender function is created that will take input a movie and will return 5 similar movies to it.

-   Pickle module is imported. dump() function to store the object data to the file.

### WEBSITE

-   The website is made using streamlit using pycharm as an IDE.
-   The code for this is given in <https://github.com/jyotsnad246/Movie-Recommendation-Web-App/blob/0fc32ac99318b289dd869c5aa65cba93b56de35a/app.py> .

### DEPLOYMENT

-   The web application is deployed using Heroku
-   The link for the same is <https://movie-recommendation-web-app.herokuapp.com/>
